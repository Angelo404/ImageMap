# ImageMap

### Run command:
`docker-compose up --build`

Once the Map is running on `localhost:4200` hit the 'Get New Images' button to get a new set of images from Flickr.
Images are only shown after moving the map.

### Technology Stack

#### Nodemon + Gulp: to rebuild and re-run the server and client on change.
#### Leaflet: to display the map and the markers.
#### Angular2 + Node.js: for the front and back end.
#### KOA: for the API calls from the client to server.
